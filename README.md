# ATM Simulation System

This is a terminal-based simulation of an ATM/CDM system built in C for a machine project. It includes features like:

- PIN-protected login system
- Change PIN and forced re-login
- Withdrawals, deposits, transfers, bill payments
- Transaction history tracking

Tools Used
- C (GCC)
- Text-based UI

Why I Made This:

This project was originally developed as part of a machine project for my Computer Programming course at De La Salle University. It simulates a real-world ATM/CDM system, applying core concepts such as conditionals, loops, and functions in C.

After completing the academic version, I refined the structure, improved code readability, and added extra features to make it more user-friendly and scalable. I plan to further upgrade it with a graphical user interface (GUI) version using Kivy or Electron to explore cross-platform desktop apps.
