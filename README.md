Introduction – Cash Deposit Machine (CDM) and Automated Teller Machine (ATM)  Simulator 

Deposit machines in banks, often referred to as Cash Deposit Machines 
(CDMs) or Deposit ATMs, are self-service terminals that allow customers 
to deposit cash and checks directly into their bank accounts without the 
need for a teller. On the other hand, Automated Teller Machines or ATMs 
are devices that dispense cash and allow you to make other banking 
transactions. An ATM typically consists of a screen, a card reader, a 
keypad, a cash dispenser and a printer.  For this Machine Project, you will 
create a CDM/ATM Simulator by using the knowledge, skills, and 
techniques that you’ve learned in CCPROG1.
